# shadcn-samples

This is a simple React + TypeScript app built with Vite. It displays a gallery of pages created using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components and Tailwind CSS.

Add new `.tsx` files under `src/pages` and they will automatically appear in the gallery. Clicking a page preview shows it full screen.
